# Insights & Recommendations

## Key Insights (example – replace with what YOUR charts show)
- Revenue trend shows seasonality and growth periods; revenue changes are primarily driven by order volume rather than large AOV shifts.
- AOV remains relatively stable over time, suggesting limited upsell/bundling effects.
- Delivery time trends reveal periods of operational strain where average delivery days increase.
- Cancellation rate spikes align with periods of higher order volume, indicating potential fulfillment bottlenecks.

## Recommendations
- Improve logistics capacity planning for peak periods to reduce delivery time and cancellations.
- Identify underperforming product categories/sellers driving cancellations or slower deliveries.
- Test bundles/promotions in high-performing categories to lift AOV without hurting conversion.
