🔹 1. Revenue Growth Peaks Mid-Year, Sharp Drop in September

Insight
Revenue steadily grows from January to August, peaking around May–August
A sharp decline occurs in September, followed by partial recovery

Recommendation
Investigate September disruptions:
logistics capacity
supplier constraints
platform or policy changes
Introduce demand-stabilization tactics (promotions, inventory buffers) before peak months

🔹 2. Order Volume Mirrors Revenue Decline

Insight
Order counts closely track revenue trends
The September drop is driven primarily by lower demand, not pricing

Recommendation
Focus marketing spend and inventory planning on sustaining order volume
Monitor early signals (order count) as a leading indicator for revenue

🔹 3. AOV Remains Relatively Stable

Insight
Average Order Value stays within a narrow range (~$150–$170)
Indicates stable customer purchasing behavior

Recommendation
Growth is volume-driven, not basket-size driven
Upsell / cross-sell strategies could increase AOV without increasing acquisition cost

🔹 4. Delivery Performance Improves Mid-Year, Then Degrades

Insight
Average delivery time improves from ~16 days to ~9 days by August
Delivery times worsen again toward year-end

Recommendation
Replicate mid-year logistics practices
Prepare fulfillment capacity ahead of Q4 demand spikes

🔹 5. Revenue Concentration in Few Categories

Insight
Health & beauty, watches/gifts, and bed/bath/table dominate revenue
Long tail categories contribute significantly less

Recommendation
Prioritize inventory depth and seller quality in top categories
Test promotional bundles in mid-tier categories to diversify revenue
